### This is a guide for common protein bars available in most stores in the USA if your goal is to have a good tasting protein bar that has good macronutrients (ðŸ’ª) and not too many unnecessary downsides (high sugars, bad taste, bad ingredients).

### Barebell - 200 cals, 20g protein, 7g fat
These taste almost identical to a chocolate bar and have a similar texture to a tootsie roll/laffy taffy/charleston chew. Macros are good and they have a neutral and non-artificial flavor. Most likely your best bet if it's available, and they aren't especially expensive. I haven't heard anyone say they don't like this bar. Basically ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
- Fave flavors: Salty Peanut, Caramel Cashew
- Bad flavors: Cookies & Cream

### No Cow - 200 cals, 20g protein, 5g fat
Plant-based protein bar with same macros as Barbell. Chewy and somewhat gritty texture. I don't really care about the plant-based aspect but if that's important to you then enjoy. One of the best plant-based bars, since most taste like dirt. Interesting flavor variety with unique flavors.
- Fave flavors: Blueberry Cobbler, Chunky Peanut Butter
- Bad Flavors: Birthday Cake

![Quest](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/589599496363704380/1131127005811851298/questie.jpg)
### Quest - 180 cals, 20g protein, 7g fat
These are some of the most ubiquitous bars in America, and they are a solid option for a well balanced protein bar that tastes good-ish. Probably the only choice in a lot of situations if you want a decent bar. They taste pretty artificial but if you're ok with that then the flavors are enjoyable. Very chewy and no outer layer with chunks of stuff thrown into most flavors.
- Fave flavors: Cookies & Cream, Smores, Mint Chocolate Chunk
- Bad Flavors: Birthday Cake

![One](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/589599496363704380/1131127004364808213/one.jpg)
### One - 220 cals, 20g protein, 8g fat
One bars are somewhat similar to No Cow in terms of flavor and texture, but IMO have a weird aftertaste in every flavor. Not really sure what causes this but it throws off what is otherwise a pretty decent flavor and texture profile. 
- Fave flavors: Fruity Cereal, Cookie Dough, Smores
- Bad Flavors: Birthday Cake, Lemon Cake (Not really a fan of these cake flavors)

![Power Crunch](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/589599496363704380/1131127004738093076/powercrunch.jpg)
### Power Crunch - 220 cals, 13g protein, 13g fat
Similar to Quest in that they are widely available. Based on the macros they don't seem like the best choice but they have an especially good flavor + wafer texture and are generally cheap which puts them above other bars that may have better macros.
- Fave flavors: Triple Chocolate, Vanilla, Smores
- Bad Flavors: N/A

### think! - 230 cals, 20g protein, 8g fat
While having decent macros, these tend to have pretty bad tasting flavors with a dry and gritty texture. Even for a flavor that sounds decent like Chocolate Creme Cupcake it ends up missing the mark and has a similar unpleasant overpowering aftertaste to One bars. Also some suboptimal ingredient choices (soy protein)
- Fave flavors: Creamy Peanut Butter
- Bad Flavors: Lemon Delight

![Met-RX](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/589599496363704380/1132556359544614913/metrx.jpg)
### Met-RX - 400 cals, 30g protein, 12g fat
These are filled with sugar, but manage to redeem themselves slightly by having 30g of protein. They are larger than the other bars listed on here
and have interesting textures such as the apple pie flavor having what tastes like apple pie filling glazed on the top. The flavors are actually very
good but the sugar and higher amount of calories makes it less likely to be a daily bar for me.
- Fave flavors: Crispy Apple Pie, Cookie Dough, Vanilla Caramel Churro
- Bad Flavors: Birthday Cake (Probably, haven't had it)

![RX Bar](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/589599496363704380/1132556551190745088/rxbarr.png)
### RXBar - Various macros, between 10g-13g protein / 180-230 cals / 10-12g fat depending on flavor, 
This might be a controversial spot to put these (I know many people enjoy them), since they have a very clean ingredient list and have pretty good flavor all around.
However, there are a few things wrong with these for me. The fact that there are flavors that have 230 calories and only 10g of protein means that these start
to leave the area of what I would consider a "protein bar" and more so enter the category of "energy bar" or "breakfast bar". Also the ~10g of sugar doesn't help.
- Fave flavors: Peanut Butter Chocolate, Chocolate Sea Salt
- Bad Flavors: Mixed Berry

### Builders Bar - 290 cals, 20g protein, 10g fat
Similar to regular Clif bars these seem to be targeted towards outdoorsy or sporty people however most athletes I know would tend to avoid both the protein 
and non-protein varieties of cliff bars. The flavor in these isn't really that good and you get an extremely high amount of sugar (20g). They have been in the market a long time and seem outdated at this point.
- Fave flavors: N/A
- Bad Flavors: Chocolate Mint

![gatorade](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/589599496363704380/1131127032672165928/gatorade.jpg)
### Gatorade - 350 cals, 20g protein, 13g fat
This is probably the most confused bar in that it's marketed as a sports/performance enhancing bar, but has an extremely high amount of sugar (29g? wtf?) which puts it near the bottom in terms of ratio of calories to protein. It's the only bar here that tastes like an actual candy bar (it is). This bar also has been out a long time and seems to need an update.
- Fave flavors: N/A
- Bad Flavors: Peanut Butter Chocolate

### Pure Protein - 200 cals, 20g protein, 7g fat
These taste so bad. Oh my God. Why.
- Fave flavors: N/A
- Bad Flavors: All of them
