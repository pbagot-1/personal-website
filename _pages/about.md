I'm a software engineer with a decade of programming experience. I've worked at two startups full time ([Kandji](https://www.kandji.io/), [Plutoshift](https://plutoshift.com/)) as a full stack developer. I enjoy working with large scale systems that serve a large userbase and solving challenging problems along the way.

I am especially interested in game design/development, social media application development, and the intersection of programming and art (music, literature, design).

This site serves as a way of passing on knowledge gained through my
experience as a developer to hopefully be of use to others (also to blog about random things related to my interests) :D
